Students in the classroom are not able to connect with professors as before, or sometimes they are hesitant to reach out. So, I created a full featured platform to combine time-tracking, communication, collaboration, planner and analyzing tools all in one place so students and professors do not need to spend extra time or money for other platforms.
The add assignments and add messages features are yet to be added, but presently you can register yourself and login either as a professor or as a student. Also, you can create, assign and delete quizzes on professor's side along with the section to create, edit and delete sessions/lecture. On student side, a student can see the total assigned quizzes, some notifications and and can attempt quizzes. All of the results are shown in a separate section. Students will see today's lecture in join tab and will only be able to join the lecture when it's time.
I am providing below a professor dummy login id and a student dummy login id so you can try both.

Professor side:-
dummyprofessor@gmail.com
dummyprofessor

Student side:-
dummystudent@gmail.com

I hope you will like it......
